  <h1 class="topictitle1">Style to Tag Mapping</h1>

  <div>
    <p>The docx2dita transform is driven by a configuration file, the style-to-tag map. The
      style-to-tag map enables an entirely or almost-entirely configuration-driven transformation of
      styled Word documents into DITA-based XML, specialized or not. Through careful design of Word
      templates it is possible to quickly configure the transformation to produce good XML
      documents.</p>

    <p>The style-to-tag map consists of a sequence of <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> elements, where each
      style elements defines the mapping for a paragraph, character, list, or table style to the
      appropriate DITA XML structure. The mapping document may also include an initial <code>&lt;documentation&gt;</code> element that can hold documentation in any markup language (it's
      content is ignored and not validated).</p>

    <div class="p">The basic rules and constraints for the mapping are:<br><ul>
        <li>The result document always consists of a single root topic. The first non-skipped and
          non-root-topic-prolog paragraph in the Word document must be of structure type
          "topicTitle" and level "0" (zero).</li>

        <li>Paragraph styles that map to topic titles and list items must map to exactly one fixed
          level. Thus, to have two levels of subsection topics, you must have two separate paragraph
          styles, one that maps to level 1 and one that maps to level 2, even though both map to
            <code>&lt;subsection&gt;</code> topic types.</li>

        <li>Character style mapping is flat within a paragraph: there is currently no general way to
          infer multiple-levels of inline markup from a flat sequence of character runs (this is
          more a limitation of Word's character styles than of the mapping mechanism). In theory it
          would be possible to use marker characters or character styles or, more reliably, embedded
          XML elements, to capture more complex inline structures.</li>

        <li>Each mapped style effectively says "I'm this type of structure, I go in this part of the
          topic, and (if necessary), I'm contained by this containing element. That, plus other
          details as needed for specific types of target elements, is sufficient to enable accurate
          creation of DITA XML from appropriately-styled Word documents.</li>

        <li>Common containment is determined by adjacency of similar container types and levels. For
          example, within a topic body, each sequence of adjacent paragraphs with the same <code>containerType=</code> and <code>level=</code> value will be grouped together within
          the same result element as determined by the <code>containerType=</code> value. This
          means that you must use skipped paragraph style on paragraphs in the Word document to
          separate distinct paragraph groupings that would otherwise be adjacent.</li>

      </ul>
</div>

    <div class="p">Each style mapping has the following required attributes:<dl>
        
          <dt class="dlterm"><code>styleId=</code></dt>

          <dd>The Word style ID. This is the value in the <code>w:val=</code> attribute of the
              <code>&lt;w:*Style&gt;</code> element associated with given paragraph, text run, list
            item, or table. Note that this value is not the same as the display name of the style.
            For example, spaces and underscores in style names are removed to form the style
            ID.</dd>

        
        
          <dt class="dlterm"><code>structureType=</code></dt>

          <dd>Indicates the type of target structure the Word construct represents. Possible values
              are:<dl>
              
                <dt class="dlterm">topicTitle</dt>

                <dd>Paragraphs that start new topics and provide their titles. The style mapping
                  must also indicate the topic type, prolog type, body type, and topic nesting
                  level.</dd>

              
              
                <dt class="dlterm">section</dt>

                <dd>Paragraphs that start new sections and provide their titles. The style mapping
                  must specify the section tag name and how the section title is determined (<code>spectitle=</code>).</dd>

              
              
                <dt class="dlterm">block</dt>

                <dd>Paragraphs that indicate blocks (paragraphs).</dd>

              
              
                <dt class="dlterm">paraContainer</dt>

                <dd>A paragraph that must be contained by the specified containing element type.
                  Must specify the <code>containerType=</code> attribute to indicate the tagname
                  of the containing element.</dd>

              
              
                <dt class="dlterm">listItem</dt>

                <dd>Paragraphs that indicate list items. Must specify a level value for the list
                  relative to any containing or child lists. Level "1" indicates a top-level list
                  within the containing non-list XML context (e.g., the topic body).</dd>

              
              
                <dt class="dlterm">ph</dt>

                <dd>Paragraphs or text runs that indicate inline phrases.</dd>

              
              
                <dt class="dlterm">skip</dt>

                <dd>The paragraph is completely ignored by the transform.</dd>

              
              
                <dt class="dlterm">xref</dt>

                <dd>Represents a cross reference. Intended to map to <code>&lt;xref&gt;</code> or a
                  specialization of <code>&lt;xref&gt;</code>.</dd>

</dd>

        
        
          <dt class="dlterm"><code>topicZone=</code></dt>

          <dd>Indicates which part of the target topic the result element belongs in. Possible
            values are:<dl>
              
                <dt class="dlterm">title</dt>

                <dd>Provides the topic title.</dd>

                <dt class="dlterm">shortdesc</dt>

                <dd>Provides the short description for the topic.</dd>

              
              
                <dt class="dlterm">prolog</dt>

                <dd>Contributes to the topic prolog.</dd>

              
              
                <dt class="dlterm">body</dt>

                <dd>Contributes to the topic body as a block-level element.</dd>

              
              
                <dt class="dlterm">inline</dt>

                <dd>An inline element contained by some other generated element.</dd>

              
            </dl>
</dd>

        
        
          <dt class="dlterm"><code>containingTopic=</code></dt>

          <dd>Indicates which topic should contain the element: "root" or "current". When <code>containingTopic=</code> is "root", the paragraph will be included in the root topic,
            regardless of where it occurs within the input Word document. This is intended primarily
            for prolog components.</dd>

        
        
          <dt class="dlterm"><code>containerType=</code></dt>

          <dd>For components that imply a container, such as list items, specifies the tag name of
            the containing element, e.g. "ul" for unordered list items.</dd>

        
        
          <dt class="dlterm"><code>tagName=</code></dt>

          <dd>Specifies the XML tag name for the result element generated directly from the Word
            component.</dd>

        
        
          <dt class="dlterm"><code>topicType=</code></dt>

          <dd>For structure type "topicTitle", specifies the topic element tag name.</dd>

        
        
          <dt class="dlterm"><code>prologType=</code></dt>

          <dd>For structure type "topicTitle", specifies the prolog element tag name.</dd>

        
        
          <dt class="dlterm"><code>bodyType=</code></dt>

          <dd>For structure type "topicTitle", specifies the body element tag name.</dd>

        
        
          <dt class="dlterm"><code>level=</code></dt>

          <dd>Indicates the nesting level for a given topic or other containing structure. Styles
            within the Word document are always specific to a given nesting level (otherwise there
            is no reliable way to map a flat list of paragraphs into a hierarchy of XML elements).
            For structure type "topicTitle", level "0" indicates the root topic for the result
            document.</dd>

        
        
          <dt class="dlterm"><code>spectitle=</code></dt>

          <dd>For section structure types, indicates how the section title is constructed. If not
            specified, the section either has a title defined as a default in the governing document
            type or will be provided by following paragraph that maps to <code>&lt;title&gt;</code>.
            The possible values are:<dl>
              
                <dt class="dlterm">#toColon</dt>

                <dd>The paragraph is expected to have initial text terminated by a colon and
                  whitespace (": "). The section's <code>spectitle=</code> attribute is set to
                  the value of the text up to but not including the colon. The text following the
                  colon and whitespace is used as the first paragraph of the section, if any.</dd>

              
              
                <dt class="dlterm">#toEmdash</dt>

                <dd>The paragraph is expected to have initial text terminated by an em dash ("&#8212;")
                  and optional whitespace. The section's <code>spectitle=</code> attribute is set
                  to the value of the text up to but not including the dash. The text following the
                  dash is used as the first paragraph of the section, if any.</dd>

              
              
                <dt class="dlterm">#toPeriod</dt>

                <dd>The paragraph is expected to have initial text terminated by a period and
                  whitespace (". "). The section's <code>spectitle=</code> attribute is set to
                  the value of the text up to but not including the period and whitespace. The text
                  following the period is used as the first paragraph of the section, if any.</dd>

              
              
                <dt class="dlterm"><em>literal text</em></dt>

                <dd>The text is used as the value of the section's <code>spectitle=</code>
                  attribute.</dd>

              
            </dl>
</dd>

        
        
          <dt class="dlterm"><code>useContent=</code></dt>

          <dd>Indicates whether all the paragraph's content should be used ("mixed"), only element
            content ("elementsOnly") should be used, or only the text content, with all text runs
            included by any mappings ignored ("textOnly"). The "textOnly" value is intended for use
            in generating attribute values, e.g., values for the <code>value=</code> attribute of
              <code>&lt;data&gt;</code> elements. When the value is "elementsOnly", only text runs
            with character styles will be used in the result XML. All other content will be ignored.
            This is useful for extracting metadata fields from text content where the text itself is
            not need in the XML (because it will be generated at rendition time, for example).</dd>

        
        
          <dt class="dlterm"><code>baseClass=</code></dt>

          <dd>Specifies the DITA base class for the element to which the component is mapped, e.g. "
            topic/data ", " topic/author ", etc. This allows the transform to put the result element
            in the correct location, especially in topic prologs where elements can only occur in a
            specific place in the sequence of prolog elements. The value is as for the DITA <code>class=</code> attribute, including leading and trailing whitespace. The values
            recognized are a function of the specific docx2dita transformation used. In general,
            values should be the most general DITA-defined classes, but extensions to the base
            transform may expect or recognize more specialized values.</dd>

        
        
          <dt class="dlterm"><code>putValueIn=</code></dt>

          <dd>For components that map to <code>&lt;data&gt;</code> or a specialization of <code>&lt;data&gt;</code>, indicates where to put the data value: the <code>value=</code>
            attribute ("valueAtt") or content ("content").</dd>

        
        
          <dt class="dlterm"><code>dataName=</code></dt>

          <dd>For components that map to <code>&lt;data&gt;</code> or a specialization of <code>&lt;data&gt;</code>, the value to use for the <code>name=</code> attribute. If not
            specified, the <code>name=</code> attribute is not constructed in the result
            document.</dd>
