          <li>Support for DITAVAL files not yet implemented, so the -d option for the map reporter
            and DXP packager have no effect.</li>
          <li>DXP packager does not yet support creation of DXP manifest maps (partly because the
            map design hasn't been started, much less completed).</li>
          <li>The where-used features of the DITA Link Management Service are not yet
            implemented.</li>
